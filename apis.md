  His 30 years of software industry expertise span different market segments (games,

  a diversity of clients on the patent wars surrounding mobile devices, and on their
  economic and technical implications. (In order to avoid conflicts of interest, Florian
  does not hold or initiate transactions in any technology stocks or derivatives thereof,
  except that he is long AAPL.) He is now developing games for smartphones and tablet
  computers.
